Cats are by far my favorite domesticate animal. Currently, I have a cat named Kiki, who I adopted last November. She is a white short haired cat with grey spots. Unlike many cats, she can be very antisocial around people, even me. However, every once in a while she'll sit on the couch with me when I do my homework. I plan on adopting at least one more cat after I graduate so that Kiki won't be lonely.
