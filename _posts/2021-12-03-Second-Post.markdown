The easiest part of the tutorial was being able to compare the my own Visual Studio Project with the tutorial's version. The steps were simple and straightforward. The confusing parts of the tutorial included anything involving a command line, only because my computer didn't already have some programs installed. It was difficult to translate the specific file names in comparison to the original Razor Movies file only because there were multiple movie files and folders. The Razor framework was only a little more complicated than the Jekyll framework, but in practice not much different in site styling. I feel much more confident using the Razor application after this tutorial, which laid out the steps to create a website very clearly.
