For Lab 9, we divided the responsibilities for the tutorial to create the remote hosting trait of the website. First, Zoie would create production SQL database, I would deploy the app to Azure & Jaylen would update locally and redeploy. Zoie went through the fist part of the lab but ran into some difficulties. The configure a server firewall step is where we couldn't continue, which ended up being a problem for several other project groups in the class when confronted with Lab 9. Overall, I would like to have completed this lab, both because it was my main role in the project and because we would have been able to host the website remotely.
