Some parts of building this blog that were new to me included using the terminal on my own computer to find programs that already existed.
I struggled with downloading Ruby and locating it on my computer while also using the terminal. Some parts that still don't make sense include how to navigate the terminal on my computer. 
I'm looking forward to growing my blog and tracking the progress I make throughout the semester.
