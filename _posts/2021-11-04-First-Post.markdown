Some parts of building this blog that were new to me included using the terminal on my own computer to find programs that already existed. I haven't had much experience using the internal terminal that's already installed on my computer, and navigating became a continued issue.
I struggled with downloading [Ruby](https://rvm.io) and locating it on my computer while also using the terminal. Moreover, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) can be installed several different ways, so it took some time for me to figure out which one worked best for my computer. Some parts that still don't make sense include how to navigate the terminal on my computer, but after working through this lab I started to master the program.
I'm looking forward to growing my blog and tracking the progress I make throughout the semester while also diving deeper into the building blocks of the software that makes up the blog.
