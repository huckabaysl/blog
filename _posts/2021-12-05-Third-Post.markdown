Make a new post about this assignment. You must include at least two links and two images in your post. What parts were new to you? What parts did you struggle with? What parts still do not make sense? What are you looking forward to?


This lab was much easier to navigate compared to [Lab 3](https://huckabaysl.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/11/04/First-Post.html) because I already had a grasp of how to use Jekyll, moreover, where all of the pertinent files were located in the directory. The steps were very straightforward for [Lab 4](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html), and I didn't face a lot of confusion. The only slightly new idea was learning how to create links to other internal pages on the header. Furthermore, adding a direct link to the class webpage became difficult for me toward the end, and I'm not sure if I fully grasp this idea. I am looking forward to understanding hyperlinks to a higher degree in the future, and growing my Jekyll blog.
